2. Navigate through different dashboard sections
3. Demonstrate user-friendly interface
4. Highlight explainable AI features

### Lovable.ai Integration Showcase (12-13 minutes)
**Strategic Messaging**:
"The speed you're witnessing isn't just our AI‚Äîit's the power of Lovable.ai's platform enabling rapid prototyping, seamless model deployment, and lightning-fast web hosting. Lovable.ai didn't just help us build Aegis Prime‚Äîthey helped us reimagine what's possible in cybersecurity development."

**Technical Points**:
- "Real-time model inference through Lovable.ai's infrastructure"
- "Rapid iteration cycles that traditional development couldn't achieve"
- "This is what happens when cutting-edge AI meets cutting-edge platform technology"

### The Unforgettable Closer (13-15 minutes)
**The Audacious Statement**:

"Ladies and gentlemen, you've just witnessed the end of cybercrime as we know it. Every ransomware gang, every nation-state actor, every script kiddie‚Äîthey're all playing checkers while Aegis Prime plays 4D chess at the speed of light.

But here's the truth that should keep CEOs awake at night: Aegis Prime isn't just the future of cybersecurity‚Äîit's the present. And tomorrow, while your competitors are still reacting to threats, you'll be three steps ahead of attackers who don't even know they want to attack you yet.

The question isn't whether you can afford Aegis Prime. The question is whether you can afford to be the last company standing without digital immunity when the next cyber pandemic hits.

Thank you‚Äîand welcome to the age of cybernetic self-governance."
